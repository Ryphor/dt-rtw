## How to use
If you haven't ever played Round The World on a dartboard before, the rules are super simple: you're aiming to hit each segment (1-20) in order in as few throws as possible. When you hit your target segment, you move to the next. When you miss, you try that segment again (you don't reset to 1 or anything cruel like that). Your score is the number of throws it took you to progress through to hitting 20, with a lower score of course being better. The best possible score would be 20, and there is no limit to the worst possible score.

This app allows a user to track their Round the World games with ease. After pressing start, a user with be presented with the game tracker and it will begin your new game immediately. Begin your throws, and after each round of darts (normally three throws), input your three throws as hits or misses using the large input buttons (you could input after each dart, but it would likely get annoying...). The app displays your current target, your accuracy (as %), game duration, and a rolling history of your shots that game.

Upon hitting 20, the game will end and save automatically, recorded in the Stats section of the app. Here, you can not only view your game history alongside your shot history for each entry, but your best and worst segments of the dartboard based on the existing game data, taking into account all your previous games. If the user has at least one game saved, this information gets displayed underneath the corresponding current target in any new game the user tracks, giving the user on-the-fly, up-to-date performance stats about their current target as they play.
